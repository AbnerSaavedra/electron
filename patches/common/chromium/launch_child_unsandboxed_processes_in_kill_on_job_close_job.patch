Subject: Launch child unsandboxed processes in "Kill on Job Close" job.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

When the --no-sandbox flag is used, hanging child processes can outlive
a browser process that gets killed. This results in leftover processes
on bots when the process launcher sequence is made CONTINUE_ON_SHUTDOWN
(see https://crbug.com/830954#c18).

With this CL, all child processes are part of a "Kill on Job Close" job
and are guaranteed not to outlive the browser process.

This is a prerequisite to make the process launcher sequence
CONTINUE_ON_SHUTDOWN, which will fix ~12% of shutdown hangs on Windows.
